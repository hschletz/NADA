ABOUT NADA
==========

NADA ("Not Another Database Abstraction layer") is a PHP library that assists in
developing database applications that are independent of the used DBMS (for now,
PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported). It operates on top of a conventional
database abstraction layer (currently supported: PDO, Zend_Db and MDB2),
allowing easy integration into existing applications.

NADA provides high-level abstraction methods that are not available in typical
database abstraction layers which (with the notable exception of MDB2) just
provide a unified interface to a database connection. In contrast, NADA supplies
a unified interface to some SQL operations which would otherwise require
DBMS-specific workarounds in the code.

NADA's modular and extensible design make it easy to add support for other DBMS
and database abstraction layers. The files Dbms.php and Link.php contain
instructions for this.


USAGE
=====

The NADA directory does not need to be in the include path. Once the script
Nada.php is loaded, the factory method will find and include all required files.

Example for PDO:

require_once 'path/to/NADA/Nada.php';
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $password);
$nada = Nada::factory($pdo);

From that point on, $nada will provide high-level abstraction methods matching
the DBMS in use. Available methods are documented in Database.php, Table.php and
Column.php.
